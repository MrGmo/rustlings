# rustlings

Hi there!

This repo contains all the solutions to the rustlings project found here:
https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

All of my answers include a line or two describing how to solve the initial problem.

Examples of these lines include:
- Make function public so it's within scope
- Remove semicolon after function x, no ; needed for implicit return
- Define macro before function 
- etc...

If you compare the initial rustling exercise with my answer the comments I've made should help you solve it. Ideally :).

There's 3 exercises missing in this repo because I simply couldn't solve them, not sure what I was doing wrong.

The missing exercises include:

From standard_library_types: iterators1.rs and iterators2.rs (iterators are hard)

From conversions: try_from_into.rs

Here's several resources mentioned in the project github page that will help you:

Rust Book - https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html

Rust by Example - https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html

Rustlings was a great intro to Rust so don't be intimidated, it's broken up into very manageable pieces. Good luck!
